# zoho
This is a sample application making use of https://www.npmjs.com/package/zoho zoho node package.

I found bugs in the package for example, it is not able to fetch invoices in case you have multiple organizations. So, I have made modification in the original package and placed it on git.

I'll be fixing some more bugs very soon.

To start with this application. All you need is:
1. to clone is repository.
2. Create a Zoho Account
and use this application to work with zoho api(s)
